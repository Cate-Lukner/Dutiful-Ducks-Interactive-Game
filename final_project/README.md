Final Project Proposal

Project Proposal:
An unusually large amount of rouge ducks are chasing you in a swamp who intend to break your
nose. The view is a map of swamp trees that you can weave between. You know how to climb the trees to escape the chasing ducks and catch the randomly placed coins on top of the trees. However, some ducks know the secret of climbing trees of a certain height, others do not. You must catch all the coins before the ducks catch or completely surround you.

Interactivity: Keyboard control to direct the player through the swamp trees or climb trees.
